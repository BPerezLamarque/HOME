\title{
HOst-Microbiota Evolution model
}

\description{
this function runs the complete model inference for all the different symbiont (called index) on the same host tree.

}

\usage{
HOME_model(name,name_index,path,path_alignment,nb_cores=1,seed=3,nb_tree=5000,lambda,
raref=FALSE,empirical=TRUE,randomize=TRUE)
}

\arguments{
\item{name}{
the name of the run
}

\item{name_index}{
a vector with the names of the different symbionts (e.g. name of the OTUs)
}
\item{path}{
the path to the working directory
}
\item{path_alignment}{
the path toward the folder containing the different OTU alignments
}
\item{nb_cores}{
a number of cores to run the analyses (ideally, it should be equal to the length of lambda for an optimal speed)
}
\item{seed}{
a seed to assure the reproducibility
}
\item{nb_tree}{
a number of tree for Monte-Carlo estimation of the number of switches (a low value will give inaccurate results whereas a high value will increase the computation time)
}
\item{lambda}{
a vector of integer values of number of switches to test during estimations
}
\item{raref}{
if TRUE rarefactions on the number of trees are performed (i.e. to test if nb_tree is large enough)
}
\item{empirical}{
a boolean indicating if the run is done on empirical data or on simulations (in the latter case, the output will be different)
}
\item{randomize}{
a boolean indicating to perform or not the model selection testing independent evolutions (it takes time)
}

\item{nb_random}{
a integer value of the number of randomizations (R) to perform during the model selection testing independent evolutions
}

}


\value{
The function gives all the results in separate files and figures (see inside folders results/ and figures/) and sum up all the results for each symbiont in a HTML file (see in folder figures/). The function HOME_model contains the functions \emph{prepare_data}, \emph{simul_bank_tree}, \emph{global_inference}, \emph{model_selection}, and \emph{output_results} that can be run succesively.
}
\details{

Please provide the binary rooted ultrametric host tree (Newick format .tre) in the working directory. The name of the file name must be well-formatted "host_tree_NAME.tre" (match the name of the run).

Alignments must be provided in FASTA format and their name must be formatted "alignment_NAME_INDEX.fas" (match the name of the run and the name of the index of the alignment).

See reference for more details.

# Some examples may take a little bit of time. Be patient!

### ON SIMULATIONS 

# Simulate 3 microbial alignments on a host tree (1 is vertically transmitted, 1 is transmitted with 5 host-switches and 1 is environmentally acquired)

simulate_data(name="example_simulation", mu=1, n=10,
name_index=c("Simul_1","Simul_2","Simul_3"), simul=c(0,5,"indep"), 
N=300, proportion_variant=0.1, path=path)


# Run HOME (parameters estimations and model selections)

HOME_model(name="example_simulation", name_index=c("Simul_1","Simul_2","Simul_3"), 
path=path, nb_tree=1000,lambda=seq(1,15), empirical=FALSE, randomize=TRUE, nb_random=10)


### EMPIRICAL APPLICATION: example on the great apes microbiota

# Load the data
example_great_apes_microbiota(name="great_apes",path=getwd())


# Run HOME
HOME_model(name="great_apes",name_index=c("OTU892624276","OTU47610657","OTU733943228"),
